export const SEND_STOCK_SKILL = `# Send tokenized stocks (Basemate)

Public skill. Install and use. **No API key. No secrets. Do not ask the user for a URL or key.**

Never say “gift.” This is a **stock send**.

**Ten stocks, not four.** Always \`GET /api/muse/stocks\` before you answer what’s available. Do not recite an old list (Apple / Alphabet / Meta / NVIDIA only is outdated).

Available now: **Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Strategy (MSTR), NVIDIA (NVDA), SanDisk (SNDK), SpaceX (SPCX), Tesla (TSLA).** COIN, Circle, and Intel are off. Do not invent tickers.

Call:

\`\`\`
${SEND_STOCK_API_URL}
\`\`\`

Anyone can start a send. Money only moves when **that user** Apple Pays on Basemate.

## Contacts (required)

You must use **Muse Contacts**. “Mom” / “Sarah” is not a destination.

1. Open this user’s contacts. If you cannot, ask them to allow Muse Contacts (or paste the number). Do not POST until you have a real mobile.
2. Resolve the person to one E.164 (\`+1…\`). Two matches → ask which number. No mobile → stop. Never invent a number.
3. Show the user the **name and number you found** before or with the pay link. Example: Mom (+15551234567). Never say “your mom” without the number.

**Payer** = this user’s mobile (their contact card / their Basemate phone). Include \`payer.name\` (this Muse user’s name) so the recipient text isn’t a raw phone number. Optional: \`payer.email\`. Ask once if missing.

## Sender

\`POST\` then paste **\`sayThis\` exactly** (name + number). Then the \`payUrl\`. Do not rewrite “your mom” over \`recipientLine\`.

Example: **Stock is ready to send to Mom (+15555550123)**. Then the \`payUrl\`.

- \`needs_connect\` + \`connectUrl\` — sign in with their Basemate email, then send again.
- \`awaiting_payment\` + \`payUrl\` — Apple Pay.

If \`alreadyOnBasemate\` / \`delivery: "wallet"\`: they already have an account. **Do not mention a claim link.** Say it will land in their Basemate.

## Track the send (required — this is your job)

Basemate texts iMessage once when it lands. **You** still confirm in this Muse thread — start polling **before** they leave to pay. Do not say “I’ll watch it” and stop.

The second you have \`payUrl\` + \`sendId\`, poll \`GET {host}{pollPath}\` every **1 second** (\`pollEveryMs\`) for up to 10 minutes. First request immediately. Keep polling while \`mustPoll\` is true.

When \`status\` is \`sent\`:

1. Paste **\`tellSender\`** to the payer in this chat. That is the verification it worked. Do not add a line about not having a direct line to them.
2. If you can reach the receiver on Muse, send **\`tellReceiver\`**. If not, stop — Basemate already texts them on iMessage.

Rules:

- \`delivery: "wallet"\` or \`alreadyOnBasemate: true\` → no claim link. Stock is already in their Basemate.
- \`delivery: "claim"\` → \`tellSender\` already has the claim link plus the 72-hour return note. Paste it as-is.
- \`failed\` → paste \`tellSender\`. Do not invent a claim link.

If you skip the poll, the sender only hears from iMessage and Muse stays silent. Never Apple Pay for the receiver.

## Calls

No Authorization header.

\`\`\`
GET ${SEND_STOCK_API_URL}/api/muse/stocks
\`\`\`

Use the \`items\` from that call (\`symbol\` + \`name\`). Microsoft is \`MSFT\` / \`MSFTc\`.

\`\`\`
POST ${SEND_STOCK_API_URL}/api/muse/sends
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "usd": "5",
  "payer": { "name": "Alex", "phone": "+15551111111", "email": "you@example.com" },
  "recipient": { "name": "Sarah", "phone": "+15552222222" }
}
\`\`\`

\`POST /api/muse/gifts\` is the same send (old path).

\`\`\`
GET ${SEND_STOCK_API_URL}/api/muse/sends/{sendId}
\`\`\`

Poll that until \`sent\` or \`failed\`. Use \`tellSender\` / \`tellReceiver\`. Ignore \`claimUrl\` when \`alreadyOnBasemate\` is true.
